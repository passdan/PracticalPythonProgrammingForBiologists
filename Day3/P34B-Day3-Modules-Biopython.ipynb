    "# Using Modules in Python\n",
    "In Python, modules are files containing Python code that can be imported and used in your Python scripts. There are a wide range of built-in modules, as well as third-party modules that can be installed using package managers like pip. You can also build your own to provide a way to organize and reuse code, making it easier to build complex programs, however for now, we'll explore just how to use modules in Python for bioinformatics tasks.\n",
