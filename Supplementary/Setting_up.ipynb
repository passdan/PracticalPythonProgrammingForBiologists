    "You can follow these course materials with any python installation, but for this course we're going to use VScode and the google colab environment to ensure we're all using the same tools. Later in the course we will run python on our own computers, but as there can be issues with instalations, admin permissions, windows vs macs etc., it's good to start first with something we know works for everyone!"
