Any code you have written or used this week should be equally comfortable on a local computer or a Jupyter notebook, and it just requires informing the code where it is.\n","\n","### Stages for creating an independent python program\n","\n","1. **Open a new file for your script**: Write your Python code in a file with a .py extension - it is not technically essential but good practice.\n","\n","2. **Define the shebang line**: The first line of your script must include a shebang line to specify that it is Python and which interpreter to be used. This ensures that the correct Python version is invoked when running the script. \n","\n","For example:\n","` #!/usr/bin/python` \n","   or\n","`#!/usr/bin/env python3`\n","\n","This will vary depending on your computer. Typing ```which python``` on the command line will show you what to use.\n","\n","3. **Write your code!**: Now's the time to put all your code in there. Once you're finished, save and exit. \n","\n","3. **Add executable permissions**: If you are working on a Unix/Linux system (macs are a unix system), you need to make your Python script executable by assigning the appropriate permissions. Use the chmod command to set the executable permission: \n","\n","        chmod +x script.py\n","\n","4. **Run the script**: On the terminal move to the directory where your Python script is located, and run the script using ```./script.py```. If you have set up the shebang line correctly it shouldn't need you to specify python, but you can optionally do that if required: ```python script.py```\n","\n","        ./script.py"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"A_SWnY9bp3Kc"},"source":["### Exercise - Run your code\n","\n","Take the code below and turn it into a command line program.
